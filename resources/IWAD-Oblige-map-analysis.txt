// IDEA FOR CLASSIC IWAD MAPS MODULE FOR OBADDON //
// UPDATED DECEMBER 4th, 2020 //

- Can give a similar experience to the original maps created
- by id software.

*** IMPORTANT ***

- Options not listed must default to user choice and module
- must override all map architecture, miscellaneous themes,
- monsters, special addons and Jokewad modules listed below.

- Mandatory options: As Original theme, no Mix-In choice, no episode selection,
- no intermission disabling, no glowing flats, no fog, no custom trees, no environment
- theme choice, no Jokewad option.

-- If coiossal size probes to problematic in generation, use huge
-- size.
